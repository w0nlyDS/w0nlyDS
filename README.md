- 👋 Hi, I’m @w0nlyDS
- 👀 I’m interested in making data based decisions in the chemical engineering field. As the world moves towards automation, it is a necessity for an engineers to use statistical analysis with business acumen.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my python, SQL, and machine learning through Kaggle. Rather than focus on learning from MOOC sites, why not solve a problem?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kaggle.
